# Hi there. I'm Caye 👋🏽
I'm based in Manila, Philippines, and I'm part of the Casa team. I've been building things on the web since 2018 (sometimes I [write](https://mcborreo.medium.com) about them), and I primarily use React/NodeJS for my projects.

You may reach me through Slack or via email at caye.borreo@telusinternational.com. I'm active 3pm-12mn, Manila time (PHT).
