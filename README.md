# Hi, I'm Caye 👋🏽
- 📌 I'm based in Manila, Philippines, and I'm part of the Casa team.
- 🌐 I've been building things on the web since 2018, and I primarily use React for my projects.
- 👩🏽 Outside of work, I [code](https://github.com/cayeborreo) for fun and sometimes [write](https://mcborreo.medium.com) what I learn.

Nice meeting you!
